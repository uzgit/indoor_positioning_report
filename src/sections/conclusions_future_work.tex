Kalman filtering and particle filtering/sequential importance filtering can improve the performance
of the DecaWave system in V207.
Optical flow in V207 is difficult because the floor is too self-similar.
Depth flow velocity estimation is possible but needs to be more sophisticated than implemented here
in order to handle obstacles that move in the frame.
Future work includes making the environment more suitable for optical flow, making the depth flow
velocity estimation more sophisticated, and implementing the heading-aware Kalman filtering.
